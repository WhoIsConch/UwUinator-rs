# Welcome to the UwUinator

The UwUinator is a CLI program that fills a directory with what we call "UwU files." By default, this is a PNG image titled "uwu.png." In reality, this file can be whatever you want it to, and can be specified in the program. 

## Use the UwUinator

```bash
uwurs.exe [path] [options] 
```

### Options
`--file` - The file to be copied into the directory. Default is "uwu.png"

`--amount` - The amount of files to be copied into the directory. Default is as many as it takes to fill the directory.

`--storage` - The amount of storage the UwUinator should take up.
